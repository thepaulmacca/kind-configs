# Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) Configs

This repo contains kind configs that have been taken from the [quick start docs](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#advanced), slightly tweaked for certain scenarios.

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.

Kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development, CI, or learning.
